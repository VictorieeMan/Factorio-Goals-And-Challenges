# Factorio-Goals-And-Challenges
Listing ideas of goals and challenges for players to enrich their Factorio gaming experience.

To help get more variations when playing the game https://www.factorio.com/, this repository is set up to collect, categorize and catalogue some community created ideas of goals and callenges for the game. It's easy to get stuck within one's pattern of playing after a sufficient ammount of hours and some fresh ideas might help getting past that and force a different kind of gameplay.

If you think you got some interesting ideas for senior Factorio players to put their teeth into, feel free to suggest them to this repository. The more ideas the better.

After having played your fair share of Factorio, it's easy to start feeling stuck in old pattens of doing things. To help with this, the in game achivements are great challenges! But one day they also run out... So then what? Well, I thought we could collect a list of fun and good Factorio challenges in some sort of list. From thought to action, I created a GitHub Repo, linked below, that just got started.

Over time, I see potential in some sort of library with extra challenges ranked according to difficulty and ratings that might help to set up interesting games for those who finished the in game achievements and such. Let's start with a list and maybe one day a mod that keeps track of Community made achievements.
